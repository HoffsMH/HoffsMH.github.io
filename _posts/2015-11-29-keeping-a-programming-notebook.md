Up until relatively recently I had not been embracing the "programmers notebook". But it has a hold on me now.
I plan to go over what changed and how I got into the note-taking groove.
I also plan to go into why, in my opinion, pen and paper actually trumps all the other tools and mediums for note taking, even when, and perhaps especially when
the subject is software design.

So upon coming into Turing we were told that keeping a notebook was a good idea.
I had already kept a programming notebook on and off  before but I couldn't force myself
to use it in a meaningful way.

A lot of it has to do with taking notes on things that have nothing to do with software development. So before we start I want to say that there are still a number of software tools that I type text into to organize some aspect of my life. So if something seems weird to you later on keep in mind that

I use

*  evernote:

  * for grocery lists, errand lists, pickup laundry etc..

* plain text files:

   * that I keep encrypted, thoughts about life when I just need to write about feelings or when i get excited, some of which may form the drafts of future blog post

* google calender:

  * not that often, but to keep track of imporant events  of course!


## What changed..
This didn't happen all at once and it took more than a fair amount of effort to get some of these habits going.
So without and further ado here is my list of things that made the programmers note-book work for me.

* I started taking it out every time I work

  * Seriously, you might think that would be obvious to me but the common occurrence was:

    * I think of something
    * realize my notebook isn't on the desk
    * debate whether or not the thought is worth writing down
    * forget what I was thinking about and go back to working


* I allowed myself to make it private(informal)

  * I was thinking of the notebook as something that I should be able to scan or take a picture of, without reviewing, and post online. The real downfall of this wasn't that I was editing myself but that I had to take extra time and brain power to think about each and everything I wanted to write down.
  * By allowing the notebook to be a little bit closer to my stream of consciousness, I found that I was willing to write in it much more often while working.
  * The notebook is a resource thats primarily for me after all.


* I stopped trying to control it

  * I've seen some of my friends note-books, and online I've seen  [pristine structure and legends for notebooks](https://gist.github.com/sent-hil/3444793) from other developers.
  * I don't have that sort of attention span or discipline  and the decision fatigue about how to categorize what type of thought I was having was deterring me from writing stuff down.

* I made it not just about programming

  * If I suddenly remember something important outside of programming such as an errand, I write it down
  * This allows me to put the thought away instantly. Because I know that its written down I don't have to worry if I instantly forget it again
  * In a sense this exactly what the notebook is for. To let me program more productively.

* I started reading it.
  * Not just when I need to remember something
  * If I have a spare moment or I'm feeling lost about the direction I'm going in with my daily schedule or project direction, I read it.
  * More often than not I haven't forgotten  anything but the act of reading it acts as a confidence builder moving forward.
  * This means I start reaping the benefits of not feeling like I have to remember every little thing all the time, [its all one tank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKTxC9pl-WM) after all.

### Advantages of a Physical Notebook

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a sense, a notebook is every note-taking piece of software rolled into one. Want to make a thought tree? visual mnemonic device? bullet points?
draw lines between connected thoughts in a paragraph? I think that the reason this flexibility is so suited to programming is that the abstractions we use to reason about programming are varied and specific to each of us. If I ask three different developers to come up with an analogy or explanation of how they understand linked lists, I would probably get 3 very different outcomes. One might think of Russian nesting dolls, another might think of a congo line. What are the chances that all three developers could clearly articulate those analogies or explanations using a single software tool?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far the neatest thing about a physical notebook is that its habit forming on its own. There are a lot of habits that are good for you in software development but are hard to keep going. Once I started writing in it more often, I found that I wanted to write in it more often. I Can't work without now. It's honestly one of the best habits I've formed.
